The digital humanities aims to work through and solve problems that are found in traditional humanities fields by incorporating and integrating today’s new technology.  In today’s digital age, there are a wide variety of tools that are available for people to use within the digital humanities in order to support their work.  Some of the more popular tools to be used today are data visualization, graphing, and mapping tools.  However, as this trend has become increasingly prevalent within the discipline, digital humanists need to remember that their data cannot always be simplified through these tools as there is more information to be found through the interpretation of the data.  This is the argument Drucker makes in her article.
	One of the main arguments that Drucker makes is that there is a distinction between data and capta.  According to Drucker, “capta is ‘taken’ actively while data is assumed to be a ‘given’ able to be recorded and observed” (Drucker, 2011).  What this means is that capta is more complex than regular data, because it also focuses on the context of the data, leaving it more open to interpretation.  Understanding the context and environment that facts are taken from is important in the digital humanities, and the humanities in general, as these details actually gives people more information which will lead to a better, more holistic understanding of what the presented information means and its impact on its field.  The differences between data and capta can be seen through using Voyant, a text analysis visualization tool.  After adding links to various articles into the tool, the key words from every articles are analyzed and compared to each article, as shown in Figure 1.

From this data, it is clear that most of the key words include “novel”, “digital”, “humanities”, and “data”, among others.  This is what Drucker defines as data; the facts and information that can easily be presented in such a format.  On the other hand, Voyant does not explain the capta based on the presented information.  Voyant can give users an idea of what the themes and main ideas are in each article, but does not include, for example, any information about the authors or the disciplines they work in.  This is important information to be aware of as, according to Pressman and Swanstrom, “the archive is not just its content but also its metadata” (2013).  If readers do not know the context behind what they are reading, then their overall understanding and interpretation of the articles will be different.  The same point is proven by Moretti when looking at the successes of different films around the world.  Moretti (2003) discovered that some American comedy films were not as successful internationally because of the language barrier.  The jokes were either unable to retain their meaning through the translation process, or were just a part of a different sense of humour that people in other countries may not find funny.  Therefore, context is incredibly important to understanding any type of media in order to make strong interpretations.
	Another important argument that Drucker makes is about time being considered as temporality.  Instead of thinking about time as something linear, similar to a historian’s point of view, Drucker (2011) believes that time is more fluid, with a number of variables and inflections affecting it as time goes on, stating that “not all days are equal.  Or all minutes.  Or all hours.”  This alternative way of thinking about the passage of time is similar to Moretti’s point of view of the history of novel publishing.  Moretti discovered that certain genres and authors that become less popular over time eventually regain their popularity every 25 or 30 years, which is typically when a new generation arrives (Moretti, 2003).  A traditional historian would see only the rise and then decline of a certain genre because they are only looking at the specific trend, however Moretti explains, “a field this large cannot be understood by stitching together separate bits of knowledge about individual cases, because it isn’t a sum of individual cases: it’s a collective system, that should be grasped as such, as a whole” (2003).  Both Drucker and Moretti prove that the passage of time and history is much more complex than it is originally perceived to be and that by looking at the fluctuations in time, it gives both the authors and readers more information to come to a more informed interpretation than they would if they considered time as a linear, given set of data.
	In conclusion, Drucker brings up some very important points about how the digital humanities looks at data and how to implement it through any digital tool.  Researchers within the field have to change their perspective by looking at data as capta and considering the where the information is taken, as well as understand that time constantly fluctuates, which in turn has a lasting effect on the data collected.  Doing so will result in having a well-rounded, holistic viewpoint on any given topic within the humanities and can lead to more learning and research opportunities in the future.
