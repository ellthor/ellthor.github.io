# Bio
  I am a third year student at Brock University, majoring in Interactive Arts and Science.  Within the digital humanities, I am interested in specializing in media archaeology; the study of new media by analyzing the older media that has come before it.  In a digital age where new technology and forms of media are constantly being created at an exponential rate, I find it fascinating to look at where the inspiration for these innovative technologies came from, and how they have developed over time into what people use in their everyday lives, as well as how they impact society as a whole.  The following work presented in this portfolio examines a variety of newer and older tools, and how this evolution impacts both our working and social aspects of our lives.

### Absract
The following blog post is a response to Drucker’s article Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display.  When dealing with data, whether specifically in the digital humanities field or in any other field, context is an important factor to consider in order to gain a full understanding of the results that are discovered.  What people consider as data actually needs to be thought of as capta, as the information is much more complex than it may seem on the surface level, or upon first inspection.  Even the concept of time needs to be reconsidered into something that flows and repeats, rather than linear and sequential.  Through the use of data visualization tools such as Voyant, it is proven that the results will focus on surface level details, but not the metadata or context behind the given materials.  Therefore, many people would be able to interpret the information in a variety of different ways.  Within the humanities field of study, and specifically in the digital humanities, there is never one completely correct answer, compared to a mathematics of science field.  Therefore, it is important when understanding and interpreting any new research that the environment the research was found, as well as the time in history it was discovered are incorporated into the results.  This will result in people having a well-rounded, holistic understanding of the results as well as the topic that was researched, and will lead interested people into conducting their own research into their field of study.

### Research Process
The first revision over time was to build off of Drucker’s original point about the differences between data and capta.  Originally, the blog post focused on the distinction.  However, Drucker directly expresses that all data is capta, and should be looked at this way.  In the new edition, the blog expresses the same point, as well as why it is important to consider all data as capta within the digital humanities, as well as more broadly in the humanities field.  Another comment made was that the post read as more of an expository, where the author’s points were explained, however not really built upon or responded to.  After revising the academic blog post, Drucker’s original argument is supported and built upon.  The idea that data is capta is a distinction that can be made in a science field, where studies that intend to prove that a certain point is right or wrong need to focus on the environment of their study, as that can influence their findings, which in turn can affect their results that they present at the end of their study.  Throughout this process, I learned the importance of understanding and interpreting given information.  In a field where people are to prove a stated argument with evidence, it is important to understand the proof in order to find relevance to the main argument, and in a time of rapid technological advancement, some evidence can become outdated if the context and time are not factored in.
